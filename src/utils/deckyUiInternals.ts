/**
 * Honest-typed re-exports of @decky/ui internal lookups whose runtime presence
 * isn't guaranteed.
 *
 * @decky/ui populates its class-map consts and `findSP` via `findClassModule` /
 * webpack module probes that can return `undefined` at runtime — its own code
 * even writes `findSP() || window`. Upstream still types them as always-present
 * (`declare const x: T`, `findSP(): Window`), so direct consumers get a lying
 * non-null type and their defensive `?.` guards read as dead code. TS cannot
 * re-type a `const`/function via `declare module` augmentation, so this thin
 * runtime re-export module re-declares each as `T | undefined`, making the
 * guards legitimate.
 *
 * Any future @decky/ui value sourced from a findClassModule-style probe belongs
 * here, typed honestly.
