"""Shared mutable state for the library sync pipeline.

Owned by :class:`LibraryService`; each sub-service receives a reference
so they can coordinate without back-refs to the façade. The contract:
sub-services mutate the box's fields directly (it is the single source
of truth for in-flight sync run state); the façade exposes property
accessors over the box so external callers see a flat shape rather
than reaching through ``service._state.x``.
